                user = https://nda.nih.gov/api/user
                package = https://nda.nih.gov/api/package
                validation = https://nda.nih.gov/api/validation
                submission_package = https://nda.nih.gov/api/submission-package
                submission = https://nda.nih.gov/api/submission
